		<h2>Last Kilometer Freight Service</h2>

		<p>In 2016, Cargone Couriers established a last kilometre freight consolidation hub in North Melbourne, just minutes from the Queen Victoria Market. Freight from outside our delivery range can be dropped off by freight clients, unpacked, sorted and dispatched to the Cargone emissions-free fleet for last kilometre delivery in smaller volumes by bike couriers.</p>

		<p>We also offer temporary freight storage that allows for efficient delivery by the Cargone bicycle couriers at a more specific and suitable time. This model has been replicated and validated internationally but is the first of its kind in Melbourne by an emissions-free bike courier service.</p>

		<p>The benefits of this service include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduced number of fuel based delivery vehicles entering the CBD each day.</li>
			<li>The provision of a prompt on demand courier service that’s also a cheaper option.</li>
			<li>Delivery drivers don’t lose time from their schedule, as they won’t be stuck in traffic.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Contact Cargone Couriers when you need cheap couriers. Our CBD couriers in Melbourne are committed to delivering the best services possible.</p>
